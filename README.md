# Snow Report

A service to get snow data from the NOAA for Cascadian mountains and ski areas.

## Supported areas

This depends on weather station data, which necessarily limits the areas for
which good data is available. Over time, I would love to add new areas, so
please feel free to poke around the [NOAA daily summaries station list][ghcnd].

1. Mount Baker (Nooksack)
2. Mount Hood (Test Station)
3. Mount Rainier (Paradise)
4. Stevens Pass
5. White Pass
